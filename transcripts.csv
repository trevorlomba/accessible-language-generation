It freaked me out,
It would be much easier,
It frustrates me,
It is so bad,
It was no good,
It is weird,
It was wrong,
"Pretty ugly, huh?",
That would be fun,
That's hard,
That's easy,

Take that away from me,
That's my choice,
That makes me mad,
That's my problem,
Take that away,
That's all I have to say,
We have to stop,
What can I do?,
